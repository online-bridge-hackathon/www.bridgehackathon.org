Bridge Hackathon Association (known, and referred to throughout this website, simply as **Bridge** **Hackathon**) is a small non-profit organisation. Our goal is to improve the mindsport of Bridge via software developer collaborations. 

Code developed is open source, as is all documentation for the projects and organisation itself, on github and Google Drive, respectively.

**Bridge** **Hackathon** has remaining funds available for grants to innovative Bridge software projects that are non-commercial, open source and collaborative.

## Background
During the first year of Covid, there were two **Bridge** **Hackathons** online bringing together bridge-loving people with experience in software development in a variety of essential roles.  Work started on producing innovative Bridge related projects. Funds were raised by Crowdfunding, domain name was purchased, servers were spun up to enable use of the built services.
